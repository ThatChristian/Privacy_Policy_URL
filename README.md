PRIVACY POLICY MODEL FOR MOBILE APPLICATIONS
This privacy policy governs your use of the software application Louis (“Chatbot”) for mobile devices that was created by volunteers. The Application is a chatbot. 
 
What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?

User Provided Information 
The Application only receives data which you type in the chatbox during the chat. We do NOT use features to enrich data. 
Automatically Collected Information 
Data which you input in the chatbot is automatically collected in the backend. In this way we can see what user inputs are given and how the chatbot has responded. In this way we can train and improve our chatbot. We do NOT sell your data. We do NOT use your data for advertisements. We do NOT save your ip adress. We do NOT try to build up a profile of you. We do NOT “connect the dots” by connectiong multiple chats to create an overview of who you are. We do NOT want your data. We are interested in bringing you one step further in your relationship with Jesus Christ. We therefore only ask data to help you get the right answer for your question.

Does the Application collect precise real time location information of the device?

This Application does NOT collect precise information about the location of your mobile device. We also do NOT encourage you to input precies location data into the chat.

Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the Application?

We do not intend to share your information with third parties. We do not want to give other parties access to the information that is obtained by the application. However, when you chat with us in for example: Facebook messenger, then ofcourse this information is probably accessible by that party. This also counts for other partners which provide a platform for our chatbot to be online. In regards to backend services where you data is stored. We are using Dialogflow to provide our chatbot with intelligence. Therefore your data is also stored on the servers of Dialogflow.


What are my opt-out rights?

At this moment we do NOT have any opt-out options in the chatbot. We also do NOT send newsletters. So basically we don’t have a newsletter to opt-out from. 
Data Retention Policy, Managing Your Information
We will retain User Provided data for as long as you use the Application and for a reasonable time thereafter. However, we can NOT see which information belongs to which user. This is because we do NOT collect reference data arround the chat, such as ip adresses which could identify a specific user. We therefore do NOT know who exactly gave which information to our chatbot. Since we do NOT know who exactly is talking to our chatbot, we assume you’re quite anonymous. Quite anonymous because we encourage you to NOT share personal information details which can lead to you as a person in the chatbot. Also, if you open one session and later another, the two of them are NOT connected in the backend. Therefore we can also NOT “connect the dots”. This means that when you said something in chat A and something else in chat B we do NOT know that A and B are connected to the same person. We therefore assume that this works in your favor while chatting as anonymous as possible. 
 
Children

We do NOT use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 16. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at facebook: Louis Disciple of Jesus. As stated, we can NOT trace back chats to a specific user. It might therefor not be possible to find the personal data. However, if asked we will try to delete such information from our files within a reasonable time.
 
Security

We are concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We have choosen well known partners such as Dialogflow to build our chatbot and store your data. We do NOT have our own servers because we don’t have the funds to run them. We do therefore NOT store your data ourselves. We trust that well known parnters like Dialogflow have the knowledge, funds and capability to put sufficient safety measurements in place. However it should be known to you that online safety measurements are no gurantee that your data will always be safe.

Changes

We do not intend to change our Privacy Policy any time soon. However, be warned that this Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. 

Your Consent

Lets start by stating that we try to save as less data of you as possible. Also it is not visible for us what our partners like Dialogflow do with your information. They might for example store your information on multiple servers on multiple continents. However, speaking about ourselves, by using the Application, you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. "Processing,” means using cookies on a computer/hand held device or using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information, all of which activities will take place in the Netherlands. If you reside outside the Netherlands your information will be transferred, processed and stored there under Dutch privacy standards.
